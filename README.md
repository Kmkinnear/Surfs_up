# Surfs_up

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to further examine information about the temperature trends in Oahu for the months of June and December that would help in determining if the surf shop business would be sustainable year-round. We also decided to take a look at rainfall amounts for June and December since we thought that would be another valuable piece of information. We remembered that in that earlier in the module, W. Avy was concerned about the amount of percipiation in Oahu. 

## Results

### Deliverable 1 - June Temperature
The first thing that we wanted to look at the was temperature trends for all of the June data that we had in our dataset. We had had to right a query that would filter the data and only return data for the month of June.

The next thing that we wanted to do was convert our June temperature query to a list and then create a dataframe from that list that we'd be able to run some summary statistics on.

### Deliverable 2 - December Temperatures
The goal of this deliverable was to complete the same query but to adjust it to pull all of the data for the month of December. We were able to use the same code throughout the deliverable while making some minor tweaks to capture December data instead of June.
